# IPR-Constructor

This project is about constructing Inflow Performance Curves of various reserviors.
User will enter the following values:
1. Reservior Pressure(Pr)
2. Bubble Point Pressure(Pb)
3. Oil Production Rate(Qnot)
4. Bottom Flowing Pressure(Pwf)

The Output will be the IPR Curve along with the information of the same.
